# Section 3 - Pre-computation

Time versus space.

This is the essential battle that programmers face. In order to go
faster, more memory is used. In order to economize on memory, more
computation is needed.

This duality is demonstrated in no better way than comparing a
calculated method (economizing space at the expense of time) versus an
entirely precomputed method (sacrificing space to reduce time).

In this section, we will demonstrate three methods of calculating
factorials from 0 to 15.

* Iteratively

* Recursively

* By pre-computation

Certainly, for the purposes of this demonstration, it is not necessary
to implement both iterative and recursive methods. We do so for fun and
for any lessons the reader can glean.
